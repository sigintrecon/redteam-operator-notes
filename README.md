## About This Repository

This repo documents a structured journey through **ethical hacking and red team operations** — from foundational networking concepts to advanced Active Directory attacks. Every concept is explained from a **Red Team Operator (RTO) perspective**, not just a theoretical angle.

**Who is this for?**
- 🟢 Beginners who want to understand how real attacks work
- 🟡 Intermediate learners preparing for certifications (CEH, OSCP, CRTO)
- 🔴 Advanced practitioners who want a quick reference guide

## Key Mindset — Pentester vs Red Teamer

| | Penetration Tester | Red Team Operator |
|--|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Goal** | Find vulnerabilities | Simulate real attacker |
| **Noise** | Acceptable | Must stay silent |
| **Tools** | Metasploit, Nmap freely | Custom payloads, LotL |
| **Blue Team** | Knows testing is happening | Has NO idea |
| **Report** | List of vulnerabilities | Full attack narrative |
| **Timeframe** | Days to weeks | Weeks to months |

---

## Lab Setup (Recommended)

```
